Passive Entry Passive Start, This system allows drivers to enter into their vehicles without lock and unlock the vehicle’s doors without touching a key, and start and stop the vehicle engine just by pushing the ignition button.

The Immobilizer function is an emergency procedure in case the passive start does not work properly or the key fob's battery is empty. It uses the same basic procedure as passive start but via short-range LF-to-LF communication. The LF field generated by the vehicle's base station supplies the key fob with power via antenna coupling. This magnetic field serves as bi-directional communication channel.
