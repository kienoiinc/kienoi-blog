# Time management definition

"Time management" is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between specific activities. Good time management enables you to work smarter - not harder - so that you get more done in less time, even when time is tight and pressures are high. Failing to manage your time damages your effectiveness and causes stress.

It seems that there is never enough time in the day. But, since we all get the same 24 hours, why is it that some people achieve so much more with their time than others? The answer lies in good time management.

The highest achievers manage their time exceptionally well. By using the time-management techniques in this section, you can improve your ability to function more effectively - even when time is tight and pressures are high.

Good time management requires an important shift in focus from activities to results: **being busy isn't the same as being effective.** (Ironically, the opposite is often closer to the truth.)

Spending your day in a frenzy of activity often achieves less, because you're dividing your attention between so many different tasks. Good time management lets you work smarter - not harder - so you get more done in less time.
