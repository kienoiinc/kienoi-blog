**Once you have planned your project, turn your attention to developing several goals that will enable you to be successful. Goals should be SMART - specific, measurable, agreed upon, realistic and time-based.**

A goal might be to hold a weekly project meeting with the key members of your team or to organised and run a continuous test programmer throughout the project.

The acronym SMART has several slightly different variations, which can be used to provide a more comprehensive definition of goal setting:

* S - specific, significant, stretching
* M - measurable, meaningful, motivational
* A - agreed upon, attainable, achievable, acceptable, action-oriented
* R - realistic, relevant, reasonable, rewarding, results-oriented
* T - time-based, time-bound, timely, tangible, traceable

This broader definition will help you to be successful in both your business and personal life.

When you next run a project take a moment to consider whether your goals are SMART goals.

**Specific** 

* Well defined
* Clear to anyone that has a basic knowledge of the project

**Measurable** 

* Know if the goal is obtainable and how far away completion is
* Find out when you have achieved your goal

**Agreed Upon** 

* Agreement with all the stakeholders what the goals should be

**Realistic** 

* Within the availability of resources, knowledge and time

**Time-Based** 

* Enough time to achieve the goal
* Not too much time, which can affect project performance
