### Description:
Automation is driving a new way of working. The future workplace will feature a blend of human and digital workforce ("bots") and this symbiotic relationship will create many exciting, new career possibilities. Are you ready to seize the opportunities that will arise as we move into this automated era? If not, now would be a good time to consider the jobs that will be emerging, and to get trained and certified in the most in-demand and high-paying skills; such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

Robotic Process Automation is a game-changing technology that is designed to automate high-volume, repeatable tasks that take up a large percentage of a workers’ time. Much like industrial robots have automated blue-collar work in factories, RPA software is coming to automate white collar work. Take this opportunity to prepare yourself for the future of work!

The goal of this course is to provide you with a clear overview of what RPA is, how it works and when to apply it, and at the same time give you hands-on technology experience by helping you build a robot that automates a simple business process in the UiPath Studio RPA software. This way you’ll both understand the bigger picture, and you will know how the technology works in practice. Further, we will look at how to pilot the technology in an enterprise setting so that you know what steps to take to succeed with any RPA initiative in your organization.

***You will learn:***
- What RPA is and how it works
- Why RPA is such a hot topic right now
- The pros and cons of the technology (RPA is not the solution to everything)
- Who’s offering RPA software
- The components of the UiPath Platform (high level)
- The UiPath Studio developer software (high level)
- How to build a simple software robot (step-by-step exercise together with instructor)
- A basic 5-step plan for piloting and implementing RPA in your enterprise (high level)
- What roles and responsibilities are needed in an RPA Center of Excellence
- Critical success factors for succeeding with an RPA initiative
- What to do next to further improve your skills after this course (I’ll point you in the right direction!)

We will also have a look at some real-world examples on how RPA has been applied at different companies.

===================
***In this section, we will cover***
- RPA - What it is and how it works
- RPA - Why now?
- RPA - Pros and cons
- RPA - Vendors
- RPA - Case Study

***Learning outcomes***
At the end of this section, you will be able to
- Explain what Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is
- Explain how RPA works
- Explain why RPA is a hot topic right now
- Explain what the pros and cons of the technology are

## What is RPA and how does it work?
### What is RPA?
Computer-coded ***software*** that automates ***manual activities*** by performing ***repetitive*** rules-based ***task***

### How does it work?
- It replicates human interactions
- And operates in the User Interface layer (GUI)
- It reads applications
- And can be implemented at the desktop or in a virtual environment

So now that you have a firm understanding of what RPA is and how it works, let us have a look at a demo; that will clear things up.

What you will see is an actual robot process automation and a robot performing a process on a desktop.

The process consists of
1. Pulling a PDF attachment from an e-mail inbox
2. Transforming the data from PDF to a row in a master Excel document that is saved on the machine
3. The robot logs into a web system and enters the data from the Excel sheet in the web system to generate an invoice
4. Finally designated users are notified that the process is complete by email.

The demo you will see is made by Deloitte, and the RPA software used in this demo as Automation Anywhere.

You might want to see the video twice, as the robot is working very fast. Pay especially attention to the fact that the robot works in the graphical user interface layer and that it works perfectly fine in multiple applications and across those applications.

### RPA - Why now?
Now that we have a little more understanding of what RPA is and what it is capable of, let us take a step back and look at why you should learn RPA right now.

The digital-human combination
- The communicator
- The supporter
- The digital reader
- The worker

### RPA - Pros and Cons
***Pros of RPA***
- 24/7 Operations : Non-stop performance
- Cost Resuction : Costs 1/10 of a human employee
- Improved efficiency : 3 - 15x more efficient than a human employee
- Quality: Increase quality by avoiding human errors and focusing on exceptions
- Valuable Work: We can focus on more reqarding and value-adding activities
- Short Payback Period : RPA implementation costs are typically paid off in less than 12 months
- Scalability: Capacity can be increased - without a long and costly build-up phase
- Internal Control and traceability - Every step is logged which offers traceability and also makes data available for analytical purposes

***Cons of RPA***
- Not all tasks are ideal for Robotic Process Automation
- Bad processes should not be automated
- Any process change means updating of RPA code
- There is still need for human intervention
- There is still need for IT Involvement
- RPA is not especially intelligent today
- Employee resistance and onboarding
- The RPA solution needs to be managed (obviously)

***Example process***

Before RPA
- Manual login to invoice application
- Manual search for todays invoices
- Manual control of invoices
- Post invoices
- AVG time spent each invoice: 2 minutes
- AVG no of invoices per day: 1100
- AVG time spent all invoices/day: 2200 min (36.5 hrs)

After RPA
- Automated login to invoice application
- Automated search for todays invoices
- Automated control of invoices
- Any error?
- Post invoices
- AVG time spent each invoice: 20 seconds
- AVG no of invoices per day: 1100
- AVG time spent all invoices/day: 367 min (6 hrs)

### RPA - Vendors

### RPA - Case Study

### RPA - Self reflection exercise
Spend 10 minutes reflecting on the following exercise before moving on to the next section of this course. Using a pen and paper to note down your thoughts may be a good idea! 

The purpose of this exercise is to help you start thinking about how and where you can apply RPA in your professional and/or private life.

> Exercise: Identify at least one repetitive and rule-based process or activity in your professional or personal life that you believe can be automated using RPA-technology. Write down the high-level steps of the process(es)

Example: I have personally created a robot to delete my "downloads" folder on my computer every once a week.

Activity: Delete all files in "downloads" folder.\
High-level steps:
1. Open "File Explorer"
2. Go to "Downloads" folder
3. Delete all files in the folder.

## Build your first robot
In this section, we will cover
- The UiPath Platform
- Installing UiPath Studio
- Get to know the UiPath Studio user interface

### The UiPath Platform
The UiPath Enterprise RPA platform consists of three main components:
- 1. Studio
- 2. Robots
- 3. Orchestrator

1 => 3 => Execute => Unattended Robot
1 => 3 => Monitor => Attended Robot

## Section 4: Pilot RPA in your enterprise
In this section, we will cover
- A five step basic plan for piloting and implementing RPA
- Create an PRA Center of Excellence (CoE)
- Critical Success Factors
- Real-World Applications of RPA

### A basic plan for piloting RPA
There are typically 5 steps in a basic RPA implementation project

#### Step 1: Identify, evaluate and prioritize processes
***Identify processes - How to***
1. Establish interest and understanding of RPA
2. Run workshops with different business functions to identify processes with an automation potential

Create a long list of processes with an automation potential!

***Identify processes - Long list***


#### Step 2: Describe process(es)

Describe processes in a "Process Definition Document" (PDD)
- Process flow description (AS-IS)
- Process facts
- IT systems
- Process exceptions
- Business Area/Department affected

#### Step 3: Design, develop and test

***Design:*** Choose process design and flow, framework and solution. Ensure that company guidelines and best practices are followed

***Develop:*** Develop and automate process (the fun part)

***Testing:*** Formal testing before process implementation. Consists of minimum.
- Unit testing
- Functional testing
- Acceptance testing

#### Step 4: Implement process(es)
Once the processes have been through testing, the robot is ready for production! We then publish the automation project, meaning that the workflow we've developed in our RPA software is archived together with all the other files in the project folder and sent to the robot to be executed.

The robot can be run throughout the day manually by having someone push the execute button, like we did with our robot in UiPath Studio; or we can schedule it to run at certain schedule by being triggered for example by an email or by a file alternation.

Let us assume that our robot should execute a process every day at 5pm, with the exception of weekends. 

#### Step 5: Monitoring and Continuous improvement
The period directly after implementing the process is called "hypercare". In this period, which can last anything from a couple of days to many months depending on the automated process transaction volume, 

***Monitoring***
- Ensure the process runs smoothly and that the output is correct
- Check robot logs and reports
- Measure KPIs
- Check dashboards
- Make non-critical and minor adjustments

***Continuous Improvement***
- Identify process improvements
- Evaluate process improvement proposals
- Establish a backlog of changes to be made to the process
- Prioritize what changes to make first
- Implement changes
